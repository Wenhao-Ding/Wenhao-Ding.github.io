I am now a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, School of Engineering, University of Tokyo \([UTokyo](https://www.aerospace.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/)\). Before that, I received my B.Eng. and M.S. degrees in Transportation Engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics \([NUAA](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/)\) in 2020 and 2023, respectively. 

My research interests focus on **Air Transportation Network Planning** and **Air Traffic Management**. The methodologies I employ include but are not limited to network science, distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and stochastic programming (SP).

I am now advised by [Prof. Eri Itoh](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/people/k0001_02908.html) at [Aerospace Mobility Lab](https://sites.google.com/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/itoh-laboratory/). You can find my CV by clicking [here](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). If you want to know more about me, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:wenhaoding@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp).

Research Interests
======
* Optimization under uncertainty
* Network modelling
* Air Transport Management
* Aviation data mining

My research interests lie in avation data mining and optimization problems in the field of air transportation. Three particular questions are
1. How to adapt 
1. How to utilize
1. How physical traffic flow models can be integrated with deep learning.
