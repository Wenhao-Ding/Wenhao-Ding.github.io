I am now a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, School of Engineering, University of Tokyo \([UTokyo](https://www.aerospace.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/)\). Before that, I received my B.Eng. and M.S. degrees in Transportation Engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics \([NUAA](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/)\) in 2020 and 2023, respectively. 

My research interests focus on **Air Transportation Network Planning** and **Air Traffic Management**. The methodologies I employ include but are not limited to network science, distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and stochastic programming (SP).

I am now advised by [Prof. Eri Itoh](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/people/k0001_02908.html) at [Aerospace Mobility Lab](https://sites.google.com/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/itoh-laboratory/). You can find my CV by clicking [here](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). If you want to know more about me, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:wenhaoding@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp).

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in the intersection of network science and optimization for air transportation systems. Specifically, I explore the following three areas:

* **Optimization under Uncertainty in Air Traffic Management：** 
Designing robust and adaptive optimization frameworks to manage air traffic flows amid uncertain operational conditions. This includes applying distributionally robust optimization and stochastic programming techniques to schedule flights, allocate capacity, and mitigate congestion at critical airspace hotspots.

* **Network Analytics for Air Transportation Systems：** 
Modeling and analyzing the structure and dynamics of air transportation networks using tools from complex network science. My recent work includes high-order network modeling based on passenger itineraries, identifying functionally critical hubs in air transport networks, and evaluating system resilience under disruptions.

* **Airline Network Planning and Resilience Design:** 
Developing data-driven models for airline route planning, connection design, and system-wide resilience evaluation. Recent research includes optimizing connecting flights under uncertain demand, and assessing the trade-off between network efficiency and redundancy.
