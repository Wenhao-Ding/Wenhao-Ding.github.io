In July 2024, I attended the **27th ATRS World Conference** held in Lisbon, Portugal. I gave a presentation on my recent research in air transportation network analysis.

It was a great opportunity to engage with international researchers and receive valuable feedback.

Here are two photos from the conference and the city:
