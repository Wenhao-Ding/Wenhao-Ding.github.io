In February 2025, I visited **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)** in Singapore to attend the **Singapore–Japan International Workshop on Air Transportation R&D** — a technical interchange meeting between **NTU's Air Traffic Management Research Institute (ATMRI)** and **University of Tokyo**.

The event was held from **February 17 to 19**, bringing together researchers and practitioners from both countries to share insights and promote cross-border collaboration in air transportation research.

During the workshop, I gave a presentation focusing on strategies to **improve network connectivity for airlines**, drawing from my ongoing work in air transportation network analysis.

It was a valuable opportunity to engage with leading scholars in the field, learn from ongoing projects at ATMRI, and explore possibilities for future academic collaboration between Singapore and Japan.

_It was an inspiring international exchange experience that deepened our mutual understanding of air traffic research frontiers._
